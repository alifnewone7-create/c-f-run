# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

When clicking a strategy card (e.g., AlphaGrid), the ring closes but the strategy field value remains 'Coco SmartFlow' instead of updating to the selected strategy. The onPick callback appears to be called (ring closes) but onChange is not updating the parent state. VERIFIED WORKING: (1) Engine mode chip shows CPU icon (not Sparkles) on all 3 flows, (2) All 5 cards render correctly with single-line text overlay (white-space: nowrap), uppercase letterspaced taglines, no duplicate baked titles, (3) Ring opens on Live/Injector/Future flows, (4) Page behind ring is hidden (data-ring-open='stg', body overflow hidden), (5) X button closes ring, (6) Escape key closes ring, (7) Backdrop closes ring (with force=True), (8) Scrolling smooth on mobile, (9) Check badge shows on selected card. MINOR ISSUE: Strategy image files show ERR_ABORTED in console (card-*-v3-sm.webp), though images display correctly (possibly from cache). Backdrop click requires force=True to bypass ring panel pointer interception."

The onClick/onPick handler is not firing at all. VERIFIED WORKING: (1) CPU icon correct on all flows (Live/Injector/Future), (2) All 5 cards render correctly - names on single line with white-space:nowrap CSS, taglines with text-transform:uppercase CSS, no duplicate baked titles, (3) Ring opens correctly on all 3 flows, (4) Page visibility correct (data-ring-open='stg' set while open, removed when closed, body overflow hidden while open), (5) X button closes ring, (6) Escape key closes ring, (7) Backdrop click closes ring.

        comment: "RETEST AFTER SELECTION FIX - ALL TESTS PASSED ✅. Comprehensive testing completed on mobile (390x844) and desktop (1920x900) across all 3 flows (Live Signals, Injector, Future Signals). NEW BEHAVIOR VERIFIED: (1) Tapping center (seam between cards) correctly selects the card shown at the FRONT (footer label) - tested 3 iterations per flow, ring closes and value updates correctly every time. (2) Tapping empty space (x=30, y=300) closes picker without changing selection. (3) Horizontal swipe (200px drag) rotates ring without selecting or closing. (4) X button, Escape key, and backdrop click all close ring without changing selection. (5) Selected card shows check badge (data-on='true'). (6) All 5 cards render correctly with single-line names (white-space: nowrap CSS) and uppercase taglines (text-transform: uppercase CSS). (7) No console errors detected. The idxFromTarget function correctly identifies: direct card taps, center/seam taps (returns frontIdx.current), and empty space taps (returns -1). The onPointerUp handler properly distinguishes between taps (selects) and drags (rotates only). All previous critical bugs are now RESOLVED."
